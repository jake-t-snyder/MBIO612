   * Include any missing keywords that will simplify the concepts diagrams 


`Push`, `Repository`, `Clone`, `Pull`, `Pull Request`, `Branch`, `Merging`, `Github Client`, `README file`, `Private or Public`

#### Question 1

`matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6) , nrow = 3)`

* Running the expression produces the following matrix

|  |  |
|---|---|
| 1 | 4 |
| 2 | 5 |
| 3 | 6 |

* How can you modify the call to `matrix()` to produce the following matrix instead?

|   | col_1 |  col_2 |
| --- |---|---|
| row_1 | 1 | 2 |
| row_2 | 3 | 4 |
| row_3 | 5 | 6 |

* Note that you need to name the columns (col_1 and col_2) and name the rows (row_1, row_2, row_3)

Hint: Use the `?` symbol to invoke the matrix documentation

```{r}

matrix <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

colnames(matrix) <- c("col_1", "col_2")
rownames(matrix) <- c("row_1", "row_2", "row_3")

matrix

```

#### Question 2

* Load then sort the airquality data frame on its `Temp` and `Solar.R` columns in reverse order (largest to smallest values)
  * The function to sort a data frame is called order
* Display only the first 15 lines of your table

```{r}

aq <- airquality

#sorting data frame by 'Temp', then `Solar.R`, in reverse order
aq_rev1 <- aq[order(-aq[, 4], -aq[, 2]), ]

#displaying first 15 lines
head(x = aq_rev1, n = 15)


#sorting data frame by 'Solar.R', then `Temp`, in reverse order
aq_rev2 <- aq[order(-aq[, 2], -aq[, 4]), ]

#displaying first 15 lines
head(x = aq_rev2, n = 15)

```

#### Question 3

* Sort the airquality data frame on its `Temp` in decreasing order and `Solar.R` in increasing order
* Display only the first 15 lines of your table

```{r}

aq <- airquality

#sorting data frame by 'Temp' in decreasing order, then `Solar.R` in increasing order
aq_rev3 <- aq[order(-aq[, 4], aq[, 2]), ]

#displaying first 15 lines
head(x = aq_rev3, n = 15)


#sorting data frame by `Solar.R` in increasing order, then `Temp` in decreasing order
aq_rev4 <- aq[order(aq[, 2], -aq[, 4]), ]

#displaying first 15 lines
head(x = aq_rev4, n = 15)

```

#### Question 4

* There are various ways to select a subset of observations from a data frame.

* Consult your [R Reference Card](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Baggott-refcard-v2.pdf), see `Data Selection and Manipulation` section.
  * What operations can you use to select all observations where the temperature is 72. Give at least two different answers to this question


```{r}

#selecting all observations where Temp = 72 with "which" function
T72.w <- aq[which(aq$Temp == 72), ]
head(T72.w)

#selecting all observations where Temp = 72 with "subset" function
T72.s <- subset(x = aq, Temp == 72)
head(T72.s)

```

#### Question 6

* You may have noticed when working with the `airqulity` data that some values show as `NA`
 * `NA` stands for not available, or missing values.
* A major part of data wrangling consists of cleaning missing values by either:
  * Dropping the lines that have missing values
   * Sometimes we can drop the column with missing values if the column is made of predominantly missing values
  * Imputing the missing values, which uses educated guesses (or more complex algorithms) to fill the missing values
  
* Find and remove all rows that are missing values for the `Solar.R` or `Ozone` variables
* Save the cleaned data to a new data frame called airquality_no_na
  * How many lines have been removed?

```{r}

#creating dataframe with "NA" values from Solar.R and Ozone columns removed using "which" function
airquality_no_na <- aq[which(aq$Solar.R != "NA", aq$Ozone != "NA" ), ]

#7 lines were removed
lines.removed = nrow(aq) - nrow(airquality_no_na)
lines.removed
```

#### Question 7
* Let's use a different strategy and impute the missing value.
  * replace the missing values for Solar.R using that month's average.
  * Example:
    * The missing value for line 6 should be replaced with the average for month 5.
    * The missing value for line 97 should be replaced with the average for month 8.

```{r}
#saving dataframe in variable
aq <- airquality

#Writing function that takes input "x" (month #) to subset aq into a smaller dataframe with data for only one month #. The function then calculates the mean of the Solar.R for that month, and replaces each "NA" value in the Solar.R column with the monthly mean.
na.rm <- function(x) {
  Mo <- aq[which(aq$Month == x), ]
  AvgMo <- mean(Mo$Solar.R, na.rm = TRUE)
  Mo[["Solar.R"]][is.na(Mo[["Solar.R"]])] <- AvgMo
  print(Mo)
}

#apply function across all month # in dataframe
Mo5 <- na.rm(x = 5)
Mo6 <- na.rm(x = 6)
Mo7 <- na.rm(x = 7)
Mo8 <- na.rm(x = 8)
Mo9 <- na.rm(x = 9)

#concatenate dataframes
new.df <- rbind(Mo5, Mo6, Mo7, Mo8, Mo9)
new.df

```
